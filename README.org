#+TITLE: Advent of Code Attempts

This repository is the central repository for all my advent of code attempts. The repo is based on the excellent [[https://github.com/samcoy3/advent-of-code-template][advent of code template]] template repository.

This branch contains solutions for all 25 days. Day 23 part (b) is commented out by default because it takes a long time to run, simply uncomment it and be prepared to wait (a while...). There is no Day 25 part (b) this year.
